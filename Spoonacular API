register to use the Spoonacular API (there is a free version that should get the job done) via https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard

when sending requests to the Spoonacular API, you’ll need to add a query param called apiKey (with the appropriate api key value) to your requests in order for the requests to be successful.
Create a web app using the start.spring.io generator. You’ll need to make sure you use Java 11 in the advanced section, and you’ll also need to add the Web dependency.
With a fresh Spring Boot project ready to go, you’ll need to create a Controller that has the following endpoints:

@GetMapping("mealplanner/week")

public ResponseEntity<WeekResponse> getWeekMeals(String numCalories, String diet, String exclusions)

@GetMapping("mealplanner/day")

public ResponseEntity<DayResponse> getDayMeals(String numCalories, String diet, String exclusions)

The WeekResponse and DayResponse Java objects will be a representation of the JSON Strings that are sent to you from the Spoonacular API. 
 would recommend using Postman to send GET requests to these two endpoints with different query params to ensure that the filtering process is working properly (i.e. it’s limiting the number of calories per day, and limiting meals by the types of diets / exclusions)
 
extract the actual URL for the generate meal plan endpoint into your application.properties file.

So instead of hard-coding the API’s URL into your Java code, you can instead break the URL into parts and store that in a properties file like so:

spoonacular.urls.base=https://api.spoonacular.com

spoonacular.urls.mealplan=/mealplanner/generate
